#Python Exercises -- last minute ideas - Jan 12, 2016

[Python](https://www.python.org) demonstration code for the Computer Science 20/30 pilot teacher meeting held on Jan 12, 2016. Much of the ideas for these exercises come from [Interactive Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html).

- basic structures, if needed (depends on teachers comfort level)
    + create number game? (guess a number from 1 to 100, keep guessing until you get it)
- use turtles to create:
    + regular polygons
    + draw face of clock
    + [turtle confusion questions](http://wmcicompsci.ca/cs20/turtleconfusion/)
    + turtle races (automatic, and keyboard controlled)
    + [L-Systems](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Strings/TurtlesandStringsandLSystems.html)
- string manipulation
    + text analysis
- combining ideas
    + pig game
